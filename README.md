# dpc-system - DPC System for Programming Contests and Practicums

Status: The code is in process of making the system open source.
 If you are interested in using the system, send me an email.  It may
 speed up making it available here.

The system is based on Perl CGI scripts and assumes the Linux environment
and file system.  It does not use a database system, but instead
writes to plain files and creates directories to save data.
